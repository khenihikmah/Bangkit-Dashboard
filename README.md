# How to Run The Dashboard

### Setup environment
In this case, I have had an environment called `sparta_da` that contains the list of packages that required. So, I should activate that environment.

```
conda activate sparta_da
```
### Create the file `.py`
I use Visual Studio Code to create the file. The file contains codes that will present what you want in the dashboard. In this case, my file `.py` is called `dashboard_project1`.

# Run Streamlit app
To run codes in file `.py`, you need to open your terminal (me: command prompt) and navigate the path to the `dashboard_project1.py ` folder that was previously created. For example you can see what I did.
